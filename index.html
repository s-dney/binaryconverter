    <div class="animated fadeIn" style="font-size:24px; position:absolute; top:300px; left:20px;">
      <p1><b>Binary</b> is a way of representing numbers and other information using only two states (1 and 0).
        Binary is <b>base 2.</b> That means that instead of having a ones place (10⁰), a tens place (10¹), a hundreds place (10²) and so on,
        it has a ones place (2⁰), a twos place (2¹), a fours place (2²), and so on. Binary is used in computer code to represent information, from text documents to running applications. The 1s and 0s are recorded as <b>states</b> (on or off) in tiny electrical components called
          <b>transistors</b>. This is how computers store memory. </p1>
        <br> <br>
        <p1> This is a calculator that lets you create any base 10 number up
          to 511 by clicking the binary digits up top. Try to see what numbers you can make!</p1>
