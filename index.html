    <div class="animated fadeIn" style="width:300px; font-size:20px;">
      <p1><b>Binary</b> is a way of representing numbers and other information using only two states (1 and 0).
        Binary is <b>base 2.</b> That means that instead of having a ones place (10⁰), a tens place (10¹), a hundreds place (10²) and so on,
        it has a ones place (2⁰), a twos place (2¹), a fours place (2²), and so on. This is a calculator that lets you create any base 10 number up
        to 511 by changing the binary digits up top. Try to see what numbers you can make!</p1>
